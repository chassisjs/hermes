# User registration. Example.

Hear me out. User registration is not as simple as you may think.

Here you will find [the link to an extensive article](https://www.knowhowcode.dev/articles/outbox) describing the example based on Hermes PostgreSQL.

Also, you can run this example:

```bash
npm run run:postgresql-example
```

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Œ
